Description: X C Binding
 This package contains the library files needed to run software using libxcb,
 the X C Binding.
 .
 The XCB library provides an interface to the X Window System protocol,
 designed to replace the Xlib interface.  XCB provides several advantages over
 Xlib:
 .
  * Size: small library and lower memory footprint
  * Latency hiding: batch several requests and wait for the replies later
  * Direct protocol access: one-to-one mapping between interface and protocol
  * Thread support: access XCB from multiple threads, with no explicit locking
  * Easy creation of new extensions: automatically generates interface from
    machine-parsable protocol descriptions

Description: X C Binding, xinput extension
 This package contains the library files needed to run software using
 libxcb-xinput, the xinput extension for the X C Binding.
 .
 The XCB library provides an interface to the X Window System protocol,
 designed to replace the Xlib interface.  XCB provides several advantages over
 Xlib:
 .
  * Size: small library and lower memory footprint
  * Latency hiding: batch several requests and wait for the replies later
  * Direct protocol access: one-to-one mapping between interface and protocol
  * Thread support: access XCB from multiple threads, with no explicit locking
  * Easy creation of new extensions: automatically generates interface from
    machine-parsable protocol descriptions
